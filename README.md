# FLAPPY BIRD CLONE (Backend) README

This is an arcade-styled game that replicates then-popular game "Flappy Bird" â€“ the user controls a bird, which can move up or down, to avoid incoming obstacles.

The frontend repo, technologies used, and video demo can be found here: https://github.com/jshin1/Flappy-Bird-Clone
